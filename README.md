### 🔄 Data Pipeline & Flowchart

**Workflow Steps:**
1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Accepts CSV uploads directly via the web dashboard or loads existing data files.
2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Categorical encoding (brand, category, adulterant)
   - Parsing dates; extracting month and year  
   - Handling missing values, removing label-leaking columns
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creation of time-related features
   - Synthesis of binary safety status fields
4. **Model Inference**
   - Data passed through a trained ML pipeline for severity prediction
5. **Analytics & Visualization**
   - Instantly updates all dashboard charts, KPIs, alert feeds, and stakeholder-specific panels

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Packages: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `joblib`, `pyngrok`
- Browser access

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**On Colab:**

2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
!pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn joblib pyngrok --quiet
  ```
3. Write the app file:
  ```python
with open("app.py", "w") as f:
f.write(app_code)
  ```
4. Run Streamlit + pyngrok:
  ``` python
from pyngrok import ngrok
import threading, time, os
def run_streamlit(): os.system('streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501')
threading.Thread(target=run_streamlit).start(); time.sleep(5)
print("Public URL:", ngrok.connect(8501))
  ```
5. Open the displayed ngrok URL in your browser.

**Locally:**
1. Place your CSV/model in the same folder as `app.py`.
2. Install Python dependencies.
3. Launch:
    ```pyhon
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

### Sample Data & Model

- `food_adulteration_data.csv`
- Model pipeline: `xgb_pipe.pkl`

## 🛠️ Using the Prediction App

### 🔮 Predicting a New Sample

- Use the **sidebar form** to enter details for any food sample:
    - Product name, brand, category, adulterant, health risk, detection month and year.
- Click **Predict**.
- The app will instantly display:
    - The predicted severity label (**Minor, Moderate, or Severe**)
    - The confidence score for the prediction (in %)
- The new sample, along with its predicted risk, is added to all dashboard visualizations in real time for immediate impact analysis.

### 🆕 Adding/Uploading New Food Data

- Under **"Upload New Data File (Optional)"** in the sidebar, click **Browse files** or drag and drop your own CSV.
- The app will automatically use the uploaded data for:
    - All analytics and dashboard charts
    - All future predictions
    - Filtering, role-specific tabs, and alerts
- No code changes, app restarts, or manual steps are needed—data uploads are seamless.

### 🔄 How Uploaded Data is Used

- The uploaded CSV **overrides the default dataset** for the entire session.
- All dashboard features (KPIs, time trends, heatmaps, scenario analysis) and predictions will reflect your uploaded data instantly.
- You can experiment with testing batches, regulatory reporting, or simulation scenarios by simply uploading different files.
- To revert to the default dataset, just **refresh the page** and skip the upload.

## 📊 Key Insights & Results

### Data Exploration Highlights
- **Most common adulterants:** Melamine and Artificial Sweeteners were top contaminants in Dairy and Bakery items, respectively.
- **Risk trends:** Severe cases have seasonal spikes—especially mid-year—coinciding with increased production periods.
- **Category exposure:** Dairy and Beverages showed both the highest testing volume and the highest "Severe" rate.

### Model Insights
- **Top features:** Category, adulterant type, and health risk had the strongest influence on severity prediction.
- **Confusion matrix:** Model accurately distinguishes severe risks; rare confusion between "Minor" and "Severe".
- **Robust to new data:** Retraining with new CSV uploads showed stable performance across multiple batches.

### Impact Examples
- **Early detection:** Predicting new samples before market release, allowing recall/pre-emptive action.
- **Speed:** Dashboard reduces analytics turnaround for regulators from hours to minutes.
- **Transparency:** Executive/Operations can see the latest risks and alerts without waiting for manual reports.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Work
### Current Known Issues
- Predictions are only as accurate as the training data's quality and scope.
- Out-of-domain data (new categories or never-seen adulterants) may not be handled optimally.
- Requires users to supply correctly-formatted CSV for seamless upload.

### Next Steps/Enhancements Proposed
- Integrate automatic retraining and drift monitoring with regular new data.
- Add user authentication for report customization and data privacy.
- Support more granular chemical/ingredient analysis and image-based detection.
- Real-time alert email/SMS integration for critical cases.
